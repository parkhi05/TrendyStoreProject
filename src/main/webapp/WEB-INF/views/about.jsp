      <h2> <strong>What is a Shipping Information Page?</strong></h3>
   <p>A Shipping Information Page is the place where you let your customers know about the important 
   shipping details that they are looking for. This includes information such as how you ship your 
   goods, where you ship your goods from, the processing time for shipping goods, and how many days
   it takes for you to ship your goods, along with other shipping details that might be of importance 
   to your customers.  </p>

Our goal is to offer you the best shipping options, no matter where you live. Every day, we deliver to hundreds of customers across the world, ensuring that we provide the very highest levels of responsiveness to you at all times.

The time frame for order delivery is divided into two parts:

Processing time: Order verification, tailoring, quality check and packaging. All orders are sent to the manufacturer for dispatch within 24 hours after the order is placed. The manufacturer and China Post process the orders, which takes an additional 2 to 4 days.
Shipping time: This refers to the time it takes for items to be shipped from our warehouse to the destination.International delivery usually takes about 15 to 30 business days. US orders are shipped by e-packet, which is a US Postal Service product. After processing and leaving the warehouse, items usually take between 7 and 14 days to arrive at their destination but can take longer from time to time.
